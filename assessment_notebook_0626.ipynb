    "This section details the construction and rationale behind the three composite trading signals employed in our strategy. Each signal is meticulously designed to capitalize on specific market phenomena by integrating distinct categories of technical indicators. This approach aims to enhance signal robustness, mitigate false positives, and ultimately contribute to maximizing risk-adjusted returns. For each composite signal, we elucidate its core idea, define its constituent sub-signals, provide the specific mathematical formulations of the underlying indicators, and present the strategy rationales and advantages."

    "Here we define the key (mostly risk-adjusted) performance measures used to evaluate the strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Symbol Definitions (符号定义)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* $R_p$: Portfolio Return (投资组合回报率)\n",
    "* $R_f$: Risk-Free Rate (无风险利率)\n",
    "* $R_M$: Market / Benchmark Return (市场或基准回报率)\n",
    "* $\\beta_p$: Portfolio Beta (投资组合的贝塔系数, 系统性风险)\n",
    "* $\\sigma_p$: Standard Deviation of portfolio returns (投资组合回报率的标准差, 总风险)\n",
    "* $\\sigma_d$: Standard Deviation of downside returns (下行标准差, 下行风险)\n",
    "* $\\sigma_{pm}$: Tracking Error, the standard deviation of the difference between portfolio and market returns, i.e., $StdDev(R_p - R_M)$.\n",
    "* $\\text{MaxDD}$: Maximum Drawdown (最大回撤)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Core Risk-Adjusted Return Ratios**\n",
    "*This group of ratios measures the return generated per unit of risk taken. It measures the \"bang for your buck\": for each unit of risk taken, how much return is generated?*\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Sharpe Ratio**: Measures the excess return of an investment per unit of its total volatility (standard deviation).\n",
    "Answers the question: \"For every unit of total risk (both good and bad volatility) I take, how much excess return do I get back?\" It is the most common measure of an investment's \"bang for your buck\".\n",
    " > $\\text{Sharpe Ratio} = \\frac{R_p - R_f}{\\sigma_p}$\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Sortino Ratio**: A \"smarter\" variation of the Sharpe Ratio that measures excess return per unit of downside risk (harmful volatility).\n",
    "It only considers \"bad\" risk (when prices go down), answering: \"For every unit of *losing* risk I take, how much reward am I getting?\"\n",
    " > $\\text{Sortino Ratio} = \\frac{R_p - R_f}{\\sigma_d}$\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Treynor Ratio**: Measures the excess return earned per unit of systematic risk, as defined by beta (β).\n",
    "It answers: \"For every unit of market risk I took on, how much reward did I get?\" This is especially useful for judging a single stock within a diversified portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    " > $\\text{Treynor Ratio} = \\frac{R_p - R_f}{\\beta_p}$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Performance Relative to a Benchmark**\n",
    "*This group measures the strategy's ability to outperform a given market benchmark, assessing manager skill. It measures \"true skill\": is the strategy's success due to luck or genuine expertise?*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Jensen's Alpha (α)**: Measures the portfolio's abnormal return over the theoretical expected return predicted by the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). This is the measure of a manager's or strategy's \"true skill\". It calculates the return earned above and beyond what was expected, given the market's performance and the risk taken. A positive Alpha suggests genuine skill.\n",
    "\n",
    " > $\\alpha_J = R_p - [R_f + \\beta_p(R_M - R_f)]$\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Information Ratio (IR)**: Measures the *consistency* of a portfolio's excess returns over a benchmark relative to the volatility of those returns (tracking error). It asks: \"How consistently does my strategy beat the benchmark, and is that outperformance smooth or erratic?\" A high IR indicates that the ability to outperform is reliable.\n",
    "\n",
    " > $\\text{Information Ratio} = \\frac{R_p - R_M}{\\sigma_{pm}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Risk & Drawdown-Based Measures**\n",
    "*This group focuses on performance during adverse periods and quantifies potential losses. It focuses on \"resilience\": how does the strategy perform under stress and during its worst periods?*\n",
    "*\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Value-at-Risk (VaR)**: A statistical measure that estimates the maximum potential loss over a specific time frame for a given confidence level. It's the \"sleep-at-night\" number. It answers a simple question: \"What is the most I can expect to lose over a given period (e.g., one day) with 95% confidence?\" It is a key metric for risk management.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " > *Note: VaR is a direct risk value, not a ratio calculated from the symbols above.*\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Calmar Ratio**: Measures risk-adjusted return by dividing the annualized rate of return by the absolute value of the portfolio's maximum drawdown. It's a \"pain vs. gain\" ratio popular with professional traders. It compares the annual return to the worst loss (maximum drawdown) the strategy ever experienced. A high Calmar ratio means the strategy recovers well from its worst periods.\n",
    "\n",
    " > $\\text{Calmar Ratio} = \\frac{R_p}{\\vert\\text{MaxDD}\\vert}$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4. Ratios for Easier Interpretation**\n",
    "*This metric adjusts performance to make it more directly comparable with a benchmark.*\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Modigliani Ratio (M² Ratio)**: An \"apples-to-apples\" comparison tool. It adjusts the portfolio's risk to be exactly the same as a benchmark's, then shows what the portfolio's return *would have been*. This makes it incredibly easy to see if we truly beat the market on a risk-adjusted basis.\n",
